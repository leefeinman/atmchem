# atmchem

### Aspiration: 
Build an atmospheric chemistry python toolkit for researchers.

### Plans:
Overall, my plan is to slowly put together this package from every new function or script I build while working in the lab. 

#### On deck:
- Function to port .m files to .py files... specifically MatLab files housing kinetics data for a large slew of reactions. I hope to inlude the functions as well as the new .py files in this repo.

### Current Status:
A few functions for lab calculations.
